This is a test.

$$
X = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}\sin(\pi n^{2}x) + \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\log{x}}{1 + x^{n}} dx.
$$
Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below :point_down:).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
